;; Same suite as `clojure -M:test`, on the other runtime. Worth running both:
;; GF(2^8) is built from bit operations, and JavaScript's bitwise operators
;; truncate to 32 bits — the sibling `envelope` repo shipped a nonce bug of
;; exactly that family before it was caught by running the same file twice.

;; cljs.test does not set a process exit code on its own, so a failing suite
;; would otherwise exit 0 and pass CI.
