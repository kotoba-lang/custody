  "Threshold custody: who has to agree before a sealed secret can be opened,
  and whether that agreement means anything.

  `custody.shamir` splits a secret so that `m` of `n` shares reconstruct it.
  That is arithmetic. This namespace is the part that decides whether a
  given split is *worth* anything, because m-of-n is only as strong as the
  independence of the people holding the shares — three shares held by one
  operator is a 1-of-1 wearing a costume, and nothing in the algebra
  notices. `independence` is therefore not a helper here; it is the point.

  A share is wrapped to its custodian's X25519 public key with
  `kotoba-lang/envelope`'s recipient machinery — this namespace does no
  crypto, it names the AAD that wrap must bind (`share-aad`) and refuses
  quorums that disagree about which deal and which epoch they belong to.

  Sits under ADR-2607285000 (cloud-itonami sealed plane). It replaces the
  `kotoba-custody` Rust crate that ADR-2607061900 cited, which was removed
  with the rest of the Rust tree (ADR-2607072000); the `GrantedShare` shape
  it describes — epoch, deal binding, per-requester re-wrap — is what
  `share-aad` and `quorum-error` reconstruct in cljc."
